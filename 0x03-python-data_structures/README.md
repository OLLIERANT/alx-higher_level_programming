This is a project in ALX school where i learnt about data structures in  python, such as lists and tuples.

File 0: Print a list of integers
File 1: Secure access to an element in a list
File 2: Replace element in a list
File 3: Print a list of integers... in reverse!
File 4: Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
File 5: Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
File 6: Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
File 7: Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
File 8: Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
File 9: Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
File 10: Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
File 11: Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
File 12: Complete a source code in order to switch value of a and b.
File 13: Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
File 14:
