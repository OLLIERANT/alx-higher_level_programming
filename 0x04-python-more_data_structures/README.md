0x04-Python-More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
In this project, I learned about sets and dictionaries in Python. I practiced using them
with the `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods.

File 0: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
File 1: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
File 2: Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
File 3: Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
File 4: Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
File 5: Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
File 6: Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
File 7: Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
File 8: Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
File 9: Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
File 10: Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
File 11: Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
File 12: Create a function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
