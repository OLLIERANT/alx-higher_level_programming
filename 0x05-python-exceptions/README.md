In this project, I learned handling errors and exceptions in Python with try and except.

File 0: Writes a function that prints x elements of a list.
File 1: Writes a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
File 2: Writes a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
File 3: Writes a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
File 4: Writes a function that divides element by element 2 lists.
File 5: Writes a function that raises a type exception.
File 6: Writes a function that raises a name exception with a message.
